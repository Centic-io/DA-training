# Basic Training for Data Science: Preparing Your Dataset

## Introduction
The first step to becoming a great Data Scientist is learning how to prepare your own dataset. This training level focuses on essential data preparation techniques for building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)flow, covering Web Scraping, Processing, and Database.

## Training Aspects
This training set consists of three main components:

### 1. Databases
- Learn fundamental database concepts, from unstructured to structured data.
- Understand and practice basic database syntax.

### 2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Build parallel ETL workflows.
- Schedule ETL processes within specific time ranges.

### 3. Web Scraping
- Learn how to extract data from websites using web scraping techniques.
- Use libraries such as **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** for data crawling.

## Further Instructions
Each section has a dedicated README.md file providing detailed explanations and hands-on exercises. 
- Note that you don't have to do all of these exercises, take it as references to understand it. 
- Please ensure you read them carefully to grasp the concepts thoroughly.
