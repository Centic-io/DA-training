# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques, primarily graphical, to:

- Maximize insight into a data set
- Uncover underlying structure
- Extract important variables
- Detect outliers and anomalies
- Test underlying assumptions
- Develop parsimonious models
- Determine optimal factor settings

## Focus
EDA is an approach rather than a fixed set of techniques. It represents an attitude or philosophy regarding how data analysis should be conducted, focusing on allowing data to reveal its structure without prematurely imposing assumptions.

## Philosophy
EDA is not identical to statistical graphics, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Statistical graphics refer to a collection of techniques, all graphically based, that focus on specific aspects of data characterization. EDA, on the other hand, is a broader approach to data analysis that defers assumptions about underlying models in favor of letting the data itself suggest its structure and relationships. While EDA makes heavy use of statistical graphics, it is fundamentally a philosophy that guides how data should be explored and interpreted.


## Techniques
Most EDA techniques rely on graphical methods, with some quantitative approaches. The emphasis on graphics arises because visual representations of data provide unparalleled power to uncover patterns, structures, and unexpected insights.

### Common Graphical Techniques
EDA employs a variety of simple yet effective plotting techniques, including (More detail please refer this [link](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)):

1. **Plotting raw data**
   - Data traces
   - Histograms
   - Bihistograms
   - Probability plots
   - Lag plots
   - Block plots
   - Youden plots

2. **Plotting simple statistics**
   - Mean plots
   - Standard deviation plots
   - Box plots
   - Main effects plots

3. **Optimizing visualization**
   - Arranging multiple plots per page to enhance pattern recognition and maximize analytical insights

EDA empowers analysts to explore data in an open-minded manner, leveraging visualization techniques to uncover hidden structures and relationships within the dataset.
